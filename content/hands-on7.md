# Insets
What they are; why helpful.

This page will demonstrate how to make a map of British Columbia with an inset showing Canada. Will be in black and white. (or choose something else like using the Native Land digital data)

here is what it will look like below.

Considerations. 
Where to locate it. 
Adding a frame or call out. 
Leader lines

Zooming in, scale. If zooming out, no scale. 
When to use a north arrow. 

Inset might have different projection.
