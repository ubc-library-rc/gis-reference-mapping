# Hands On
This section will guide you through making simple reference maps for academic publication. You will create 3 maps: one of Canada, one of British Columbia, and one of Vancouver. 

(maybe 3 is over-ambitious given time constraints. maybe just do canada map and then basemap of vancouver. 3rd map would be an in between where people select and export just bc from stats canada data, then make an inset. if making bc map must change proj?)

Because making maps for academic publication often requires downloading, modifying, and synthesizing data from the web, you will practice retrieving data from Natural Earth and Statistics Canada. 


Here is an outline of what we will do in the hands-on section of today's workshop:

1. After an overview of spatial data, we will download and organize the data needed for this workshop. You will also be introduced to the data provided in your workshop folder. 
2. Then, we will open QGIS and load data into the prepared project. We will also add basemaps for geospatial context and set spatial bookmarks. 
3. Next we will organize layers into groups and modify their symbology, label them, and consider visual hierarchy and other publication specifications (like dimensions, format, and B&W). 
4. Finally, we will create and export 2 reference maps. 
5. Time allowing, there is also the option try your hand at making a thematic map using data provided or your own data. This is also an exercise you can practice after the workshop.

Here are examples of the maps we will make.

<!-- first part  download data from natural earth -> background -> BC in canada, point for vancouver 
add basemap too -> sattelite imgarey, revers polygon of a neighborhood or park -> mimicstudy area
-->



<!-- second part, work with pre-rpcessed data of street trees  to show you how to easily make diffferent kinds of choropleth maps. in ths section, welcome to use your own data. however, bc of nature of workshop wont be able to privide 1-1 assistance on troublehssoot data issues. -- book consult beforehand xyz. or use provided data.   -->
