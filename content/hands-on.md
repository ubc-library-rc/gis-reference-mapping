# Hands On
This section will guide you through making simple reference maps for academic publication. Though the focus will be on a map of Canadian provinces, time allowing, the use of basemaps and insets will be demonstrated as well. These optional exercises, as well as the opportunity to try your hand at thematic mapping, are documented in pages 5-7; return to them anytime after the workshop for additional practice. 

Because making maps for academic publication often requires downloading, modifying, and synthesizing data from the web, you will practice retrieving data from Natural Earth and Statistics Canada. 


<!-- Here is an outline of what we will do in the hands-on section of today's workshop:

1. After an overview of spatial data, we will download and organize the data needed for this workshop. You will also be introduced to the data provided in your workshop folder. 
2. Then, we will open QGIS and load data into the prepared project. We will also add basemaps for geospatial context and set spatial bookmarks. 
3. Next we will organize layers into groups and modify their symbology, label them, and consider visual hierarchy and other publication specifications (like dimensions, format, and B&W). 
4. Finally, we will create and export 2 reference maps. 
5. Time allowing, there is also the option try your hand at making a thematic map using data provided or your own data. This is also an exercise you can practice after the workshop.  -->

Here is an example of the map we will make, styled in different ways.
