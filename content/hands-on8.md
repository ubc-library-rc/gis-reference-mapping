# Creating and Editing Shapefiles 
{: .no_toc}


In [1. Gathering Data](./hands-on1.md), we used <a href="https://geojson.io/#map=2/0/20" target="_blank">geojson.io</a> to create a simple point layer. But what if you want to trace your research site as shown on a basemap? This involves creating a new vector layer directly within QGIS. The following tutorial will show you how to create both a poloygon and point shapefile, as well as alert you to some considerations.

## Creating a Vector Layer in QGIS
There are two steps to creating a new vector layer in QGIS. First, you have to name and save an empty vector layer. Then, you'll add it to your project, toggle on editing mode, and draw the vertices of the shape. Then save. 
start with point - if you didnt collect in csv - how to create here. 
consideration - setting projection
about points - 
polygon shapefile - from basemap
point - from point - consider projection in both scenarios (put as end Geocoding
