## Tools 
There are different software available to make reference maps. While this workshop will focus on QGIS, you can also make quick maps using xyz. (see [assembling resources](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/gis-spatial-stories/content/assembling-resources.html) page for alternate resources/software/tools for reference/static mapping ) This workshop uses QGIS --> more detailed maps for publication, also your own work.  QGIS is beginner friendly and if you're not doing more than making map, super doable. And, if you do decide to do spatial anlaysis, you're halfway there. 


If you're interested, you can also export from QGIS for more advanced editing in graphics illustration software, like illustrator or inkscape, free and open source alternative.
