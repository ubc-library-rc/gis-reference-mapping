# Reference Mapping for Academic Publication
### UBC Library Research Commons

Description: This workshop will provide an overview of how to create simple, static reference maps to accompany academic publications. We will use [QGIS](https://qgis.org/), a free and open-source Geographic Information System (GIS) for analyzing, modifying, and visualizing spatial data.  

This workshop is geared towards mapping novices. If you want to create  a map that geographically contextualizes your study area, or have a project involving data with a spatial component you're eager to visualize, this workshop is for you.  While making such maps on your own can feel daunting, this workshop will give you the confidence to:

- Decide what kind of map best conveys your research or contextualizes your study area;
- Find and download relevant spatial data;
- Load datasets into QGIS and style them as data layers;
- Compose a map that includes a title, scale bar, legend, and north arrow; and
- Export this map into formats compatible with print and digital publication.
